# Howdy!

Iâ€™m Felicia, an aspiring software engineer studying at Launch School. I started out this endeavor self-taught, reading from random books and finding all the resources online that I could to teach myself how to code. I was in the middle of Free Code Camp when I realized that I needed a more in-depth curriculum that focused on fundamentals. That's how I stumbled upon Launch School, and decided that I would give myself the best chance to becoming a software engineer. Besides studying for school, I love to play videos games (currently playing Blasphemous), read books, crochet, watch paranormal shows and hang out with my little family! 

This is my first professional blog so it will be a place for me to chronicle my adventures as I learn programming and take up new hobbies. My posts might be personal and more about my life in general at a certain time or they might be about a technical topic.

## On Setting Up My Blog

This blog was created using Jekyll with the Hydeout theme. I couldn't have gotten this site running if it were not for ideas from public repositories, and more specifically, those from Juliette Sinibardy. She mentioned Ryan Kozak and Laura Tebben in her own blog and their blogs have helped me tremendously as well.
