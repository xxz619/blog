It's finally done! I am excited to finally have a working blog with Jekyll! I was working with Windows when I first started it, but ran into so many issues with updates and whatnot. Months later, I've switched to Zorin OS and it's wonderful. I thought that I would forget how to do this or just have to start over, but turns out it was much easier to get it back up and running this time around. 

At first I wanted to write a post about my exact path to get this blog up, but because I ran into so many issues and basically hacked and slashed my way here, I decided that it probably wouldn't help anyone. This blog was creating using Jekyll, a Ruby Gem that creates a barebones website for you so that you could customize it to your liking. You can go to [Jekyll's](https://jekyllrb.com/) website and follow the instructions on how to download everything you need for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Once you get that downloaded, you can follow this video series hosted by Mike Dane. Because of problems I ran into on my own system, I couldn't follow it exactly, but the entire video series was instrumental in helping me get this blog up. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB).

I was inspired by a few people, including Juliette Sinibardy (who happens to go to the same online school I do), and in her own blog she mentions two other people that have helped her in her journey to setting up her website, Laura Tebben and Ryan Kozak. 

It was a journey for me in sweat and sometimes literal tears, but it was worth it. My first blog was created on Wordpress, and although the theme I chose is lovely, I didn't like the fact that ads would pop up randomly. I wanted more control over how the blog looked in terms of colors and layouts, and also only the content that I wanted and nothing I didn't ask for. 

I am intending to use this blog to write about my experiences in Launch School and life. I am currently in the back-end portion of the core curriculum and will attempt to write post about certain concepts to solidify my understanding of the material. Once in a while I'll put up pictures of my cat or my embroidery projects just because :) 

Thanks for reading! Til next time friend.
