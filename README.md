### Welcome to my personal blog's repository! Jekyll was used to create the blog and Hydeout is the used for the theme. In my blog you should expect to find articles on stuff related to Launch School and a few about specific projects I'm working on.

### Helpful resources:
* [Jekyll's](https://jekyllrb.com/) Website
* [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) repository
* Youtube [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) that helps explain how to set up a Jekyll website
